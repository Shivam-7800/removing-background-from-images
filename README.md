# removing-background-from-images.

This code performs the following steps:

Reads the input image.
Converts the image to grayscale.
Thresholds the grayscale image to create a binary mask.
Finds contours in the binary mask.
Creates a mask for the background by drawing contours on a black canvas.
Inverts the mask.
Applies the mask to the original image using bitwise AND operation.
Displays the resulting image.
You might need to tweak the thresholding parameters and contour detection depending on the specific characteristics of your images. Additionally, this approach assumes a relatively simple background. For more complex backgrounds or better accuracy, you might need to explore more sophisticated techniques or machine learning-based approaches.
